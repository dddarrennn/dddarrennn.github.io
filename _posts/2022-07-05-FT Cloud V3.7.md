### 2.0 Added face recognition

Usage scenario: If drivers and vehicles are not in a one-to-one relationship as a vehicle may be driven by more than one driver, when it is needed to know which driver is driving during a specific period, face recognition will be necessary for linking drivers and vehicles.

Usage process: enable face recognition → set face comparison policies → handle abnormal to-dos

#### 2.1 Face recognition

Path: Select FT Cloud in Application Management → click Application Details → Driver recognition → enable Face authentication

1) To use the face recognition function, you must enable Face authentication.

2) Face comparison range indicates the drivers who can drive the vehicle.

3) Face error to-do needs to be enabled or new drivers cannot be registered using the device. 

4) To-do cycle and To-do time indicate the cycle and time for new driver registration. The face photos that are not recognized during this period of time will be displayed in the Abnormal Face to do module, where new drivers can be registered.

#### 2.2 Face comp policy
